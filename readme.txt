This module was created for Regenstrief Real Time Healthcare Alert 
(Quality Health First)  

Description:

This alerting tool will create an opportunity to alert a physician 
of any preventative or disease management services that the patient 
should receive at the time of the visit.   If a patient with diabetes is scheduled 
for an encounter at a  location within IUMG or MMG, a search is made 
on the INPC data for specific tests and lab results.  An adaptive 
turnaround document is worksheet sent the the location (via Docs4Docs system)
notifying them of services the patient may need.  The physician has 
the opportunity to enter missing results or indicate that the tests
have been ordered. 

If a patient has been admitted to a network hospital with a diagnosis of asthma
or indications of suspected asthma, that patient's PCP will be alerted via 
Docs4Docs.
